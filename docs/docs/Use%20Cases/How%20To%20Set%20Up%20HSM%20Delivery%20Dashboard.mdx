### Problem: How to find the number of contacts who did not get the business initiated message due to frequency capping regulations imposed by Meta on Marketing HSMs.[​](#problem-how-to-find-the-number-of-contacts-who-did-not-get-the-business-initiated-message-due-to-frequency-capping-regulations-imposed-by-meta-on-marketing-hsms "Direct link to Problem: How to find the number of contacts who did not get the business initiated message due to frequency capping regulations imposed by Meta on Marketing HSMs.")

Context: Meta recently introduced something called as Frequency capping. Explaining in a simple manner, it noticed that users get a lot of Marketing messages from businesses, and to limit SPAM daily, it restricts how many Marketing messages a user can get during a rolling period of X days.

To prevent misuse and gaming the system, they haven’t told us how many messages are allowed in how many days. You can read more about this in their own words [here.](https://www.gupshup.io/resources/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-whatsapp-business-api-frequency-capping)

### Solution: To understand contacts, templates, and campaigns affected (based on dates the broadcast was initaited) by having information of errors that were encountered visialized on a lookerstudio dashboard. This will reduce the effort in repeteadly quering this infomration from the database for every braodcast made, and to make this information easily accessible to the program / operations team to work with.[​](#solution-to-understand-contacts-templates-and-campaigns-affected-based-on-dates-the-broadcast-was-initaited-by-having-information-of-errors-that-were-encountered-visialized-on-a-lookerstudio-dashboard-this-will-reduce-the-effort-in-repeteadly-quering-this-infomration-from-the-database-for-every-braodcast-made-and-to-make-this-information-easily-accessible-to-the-program--operations-team-to-work-with "Direct link to Solution: To understand contacts, templates, and campaigns affected (based on dates the broadcast was initaited) by having information of errors that were encountered visialized on a lookerstudio dashboard.
