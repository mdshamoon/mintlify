## Managing an Organization's Glific Account: Suspension and Deletion[​](#managing-an-organizations-glific-account-suspension-and-deletion "Direct link to Managing an Organization's Glific Account: Suspension and Deletion")

Organizations may need to suspend or permanently delete their Glific account due to program completion, strategic planning, or a temporary pause in operations.

This document outlines the implications, processes, and key requirements related to Suspension and Deletion modes on the Glific platform.

## Suspension Mode:[​](#suspension-mode "Direct link to Suspension Mode:")

### What happens in Suspension Mode ?[​](#what-happens-in-suspension-mode- "Direct link to What happens in Suspension Mode ?")

1. All existing flows and data remain intact.

2. Access to the Glific platform will be restricted — no login, flow creation, or data usage is permitted.

3. Data will continue to be accessible via BigQuery.

4. Suspension incurs a maintenance charge of **₹1500 +taxes** per month.

5. Gupshup wallet balance will stay as it is.

### How to request Suspension ?[​](#how-to-request-suspension- "Direct link to How to request Suspension ?")

1. Notify the Glific Support Team on email [support@glific.org](mailto:support@glific.org) or raise a Support Ticket on [Discord Ngo support channel](https://discord.gg/gYHMRGQVpT) atleast 15 days prior to the desired suspension date.

2. If the suspension information is not received in time, the system will mark the account for suspension from the following month, not the current one.

### How to reactivate a suspended account ?[​](#how-to-reactivate-a-suspended-account- "Direct link to How to reactivate a suspended account ?")

1. The organization can request reactivation at any time by reaching out to the Glific Support team via email ([support@glific.org](mailto:support@glific.org) ) or raise a ticket on [Discord Ngo support channel](https://discord.gg/gYHMRGQVpT).

2. The account will be reactivated upon getting the confirmation from the Glific Finance Team of clearing all the outstanding dues.

## Deletion Mode:[​](#deletion-mode "Direct link to Deletion Mode:")

### What happens in Deletion Mode ?[​](#what-happens-in-deletion-mode- "Direct link to What happens in Deletion Mode ?")

1. The Organisation account and all associated flows will be permanently deleted.

2. Reactivation is not possible — the organization would need to create a new account and set up from scratch.

### Process for account deletion[​](#process-for-account-deletion "Direct link to Process for account deletion")

1. Drop an email to the Glific Support team on [support@glific.org](mailto:support@glific.org) or raise a ticket on [Discord Ngo support channel](https://discord.gg/gYHMRGQVpT) atleast 15 days prior to the desired deletion date.

2. The Glific Team will schedule a call to understand the reason and explain the next steps.

3. Ensure payment clearance for the Glific platform is complete.

4. [Export the flows](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Others/Import%20&%20Export%20Flows/#export-the-flow-from-existing-system) from the Glific Platform if needed.

5. [Backup data from Big Query](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Reporting%20&%20Dashboard/BigQuery%20Setup%20and%20link%20with%20Glific/#export-data-in-excel-format-from-google-bigquery)

6. **Note:** Remaining Gupshup Wallet balance won’t be refundable as per Gupshup Policy. Please refer to this [documentation](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/FAQ/Gupshup%20wallet%20balance%20and%20Usage/#gupshup-refund-policy) for more details on the Gupshup Refund Policy.

**Important:** [Email](/docs/docs/Onboarding/support@glific.org) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/gYHMRGQVpT) intimation for account suspension and deletion must also be provided to the **Glific Support Team** at least **15** days in advance. If not, the account will remain **active**, and the regular subscription fee will be **charged** for the next month.
