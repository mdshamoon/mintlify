## Initial Checks:[​](#initial-checks "Direct link to Initial Checks:")

### Existing Users:[​](#existing-users "Direct link to Existing Users:")

* **Inactive Bots:** If the bot is inactive as in has no active users, proceed with the migration easily as you don't need to worry about end-user experience

* **Active Bots:**

  * Avoid creating a Gupshup App immediately.
  * Initiate the Glific setup using dummy values for the App name and API key to create a Glific account using the T\&C form. Reach out to us when you are doing this step to get the values to fill.
  * Manually create the account with the help of Developers as OTPs will not be received to set the password for the account you are creating.

  ### Setting Up Flows:[​](#setting-up-flows "Direct link to Setting Up Flows:")

### Creating Flows and User Experiences:[​](#creating-flows-and-user-experiences "Direct link to Creating Flows and User Experiences:")

* Log into Glific to create flows and user experiences that align with the current system. Consider giving migrating NGO-users access to a staging account for flow creation which they can later import.

  * Keep in mind what they need as default language in their environment. It will be difficult to migrate when you create a flow in an environment whose default language is English with an enabled language is Hindi to an environment whose default language is Hindi, with English as an enabled language.There could be translation issues, esp with Interactive messages.

* Every chatbot platform has different ways to create a chatbot flow. Anticipate differences in flow creation method and request that in the onboarding for Glific.

* Utilize the simulator for testing since the bot is not connected to WhatsApp. *Consult Developers for proxy use without an app name*

  * Put into place a plan to test with the real bot on their numbers as soon as the bot is live before they announce successful migration or if they have active users, have a plan to unstuck users if they are

  ### User Experience:[​](#user-experience "Direct link to User Experience:")

### Ensuring a Smooth Transition:[​](#ensuring-a-smooth-transition "Direct link to Ensuring a Smooth Transition:")

* Create the flows you’d want your user to experience when they interact with your bot on Glific. Use the phone simulator to test it and be sure of how it works.

* Create a Gupshup account during low-activity periods to minimize user impact, as it requires the NGO to share the phone number and an OTP to complete the migration. More details on steps below.

* Encourage partners to inform their users about the migration.

  ### Technical Considerations:[​](#technical-considerations "Direct link to Technical Considerations:")

### Understanding the Existing Bot System:[​](#understanding-the-existing-bot-system "Direct link to Understanding the Existing Bot System:")

* Determine if the system is prepaid or postpaid for balance recharge.

* Understand the flow design tools (e.g., RapidPro, Botpress) used by the current system to plan onboarding.

  ### Migration Steps:[​](#migration-steps "Direct link to Migration Steps:")

**Preparing for Migration:**

* Ensure Glific is set up with necessary flows.

* Disable two-factor authentication on the existing bot system by emailing your current service provider. Some of them allow you to disable to this in your settings panel.

  * Only if required, delete the bot number from your Facebook Business Manager’s WhatsApp Page. In this scenario, reach out to us so that we can help you with this.

**Addressing Blockers:**

* Check for any blockers in the existing bot system and ensure all bills are paid.

* Recharge the SIM

* Have the development team on standby for support before the next step

**Creating Gupshup Account:**

* Create the app and log in via Facebook to auto-select the existing FB Business Manager profile.

* Follow the migration instructions, choosing the phone option for OTP to avoid SMS delays.

* Encourage the organisation to do a minor recharge of USD 10 to keep balance - show them how to do it, and how to monitor credit in Glific

**Post Gupshup app going live**

* Once done, Collect App name, API key and share with Developers so that they can update our DB entry for the bot.

* While they are updating our Db, disable auto optin messages etc.

* Excute the test plan to make sure the bot is working as planned/required before “soft relaunching” it
