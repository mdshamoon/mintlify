  ## Extract Data by Flow from BigQuery:[​](#extract-data-by-flow-from-bigquery "Direct link to Extract Data by Flow from BigQuery:")

* The following query can be used to extract data by flow.

```
WITH extracted_json AS (  SELECT    contact_phone,    contact_name,    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(results, '$.feedback_positive.input') AS feedback_positive,    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(results, '$.result_q1_pos.input') AS result_q1_pos,    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(results, '$.result_q2_pos.input') AS result_q2_pos,    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(results, '$.result_q3_pos.input') AS result_q3_pos FROM    `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`  where uuid = "flow_uuid")SELECT * FROM extracted_json;
```

* All flow results must be added in a similar manner:

`JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(results, '$.flow_result.input') AS flow_result,`

* Running the query will generate a table displaying phone numbers, names, and their flow results, which can then be exported as a CSV.
