* When the `Gupshup wallet balance` drops to around `$1` an email is sent to the Organization from Glific letting them know the balance is low.

* The setting of `$1` or any specific amount is configurable at Glific’s end.

## Below are the steps on how this can be configured.[​](#below-are-the-steps-on-how-this-can-be-configured "Direct link to Below are the steps on how this can be configured.")

### Essential Guidelines[​](#essential-guidelines "Direct link to Essential Guidelines")

* The pre-configured number on the low balance threshold can to be changed according to the Organization need,just edit the number and hit on `Save`.

* This low wallet balance warning emails will be sent to the email address which was initially provided while filling the Glific Form.

* If in case the previous email address is not accessible or needs to be modified. Please reach out to the `Support Team` sharing the email address which needs to be set on the warning mails.

* Gupshup gives an extra `$5`,when the wallet balance reaches `$0` so that there is no interuption in sending of messages until the balance hits `-$5`. The Organization should always ensure to recharge the Gupshup Wallet before the -$5 gets expired to continue sending messages.

* Please [read here](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/FAQ/Gupshup%20wallet%20balance%20and%20Usage/) to know how to recharge Gupshup Wallet Balance.

* If the balance goes below `-$5`,sending messages will give an error - **the wallet balance is low**. So in this scenario the messages will get delivered to the users until the Gupshup wallet balance reaches -5 $.

* Glific gets a **balance is not present** error from Gupshup as soon as the wallent balance for an Organization goes `-$5`.

* At any moment of time if Glific gets a significant amount of errors,the organization will get suspended on Glific and won't be allowed to send any messages.

* Once the organization is suspended it won't get unsuspend automatically on Glific,even if the recharge is done on the Gupshup Wallet.

* To `unsuspend` the Glific account please reach out to the `Support Team`.
