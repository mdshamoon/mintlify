# Video Tutorial

#### Note- We recorded this video somedays back while working with an org. We will re-record a better one in future

For a GupShup account, you will also need

1. [Facebook verification process for WA business API](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Onboarding/Facebook%20verification%20process%20for%20WA%20business%20API/)

2. A new phone number or an phone number that hasn’t been used with WhatsApp(\*\*). The sim card should be activated with a minimal plan so as to receive sms verification code/call from Gupshup

3. To dis-associate your phone number from WhatsApp you need to open WhatsApp on your phone. Go to Settings → Account → Delete my account. Note - simply uninstalling the app \*\*does not\*\* remove the association between the phone number and WhatsApp.

## Create your GupShup Account[​](#create-your-gupshup-account "Direct link to Create your GupShup Account")

> **Note :-** *This is a Self-Service step. No need to contact to Gupshup for this. Gupshup may take the route of enterprise Gupshup setup, which is not useful and not required for Glific SAAS service.*

1. Next, go to [Gupshup.io](https://www.gupshup.io/) and click on sign up

2. Then create your account using Google(preferred) and **using a common email id** like `info@glific.org` or `chat@glific.org` instead of a personal email id so that it can be accessed by different team members when something fails to work.

3. Complete the Signup.

26. Configure read receipts in the Gupshup account. Please refer to [Configure read receipts in Gupshup account](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/FAQ/Configure%20read%20receipts%20in%20Gupshup%20account./) for detailed steps.

27. Upload a display picture so it can be visible to your end users.Please refere [Update my profile picture of BOT](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/FAQ/Update%20my%20profile%20picture%20of%20BOT/)

28. Then go to the Security Centre page on `Facebook business manager`. You should find the `start verification` button activated. In case it doesn't get activated instantly, you may give it some time. If it's taking longer than a few hours, contact us.

![image](/images/docs/docs/Onboarding/32592458/212237581-64976b86-a052-47a1-a685-10cc604032b5.png)

![image](/images/docs/docs/Onboarding/32592458/212237592-58a68279-af03-44b9-bca4-4e9b38d5e7f6.png)

30. The process is straightforward after that. You will be required to verify your business by uploading some documents. Please refer to this document for verification guidance: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HhcirTBjhiYdXcOUFg04uJG4yxL8vpq-/view?usp=sharing/](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HhcirTBjhiYdXcOUFg04uJG4yxL8vpq-/view?usp=sharing/)

31. As the doc will mention, using `Certificate of registration` is highly recommended to not get the approval process rejected. *Please make sure your provided business details exactly match with the detail in the document.*

32. Once done, Facebook will take 3-4 working days to review and you will receive an email once this is done. The button in the Security Centre will also have changed. Please reach out to us in case it's taking more than a week. We'll reach out to FB to expedite the process.

33. Please make sure your option to send template messages is enabled (see below\*).\*

34 . Turn off the **automated opt-in message** option (refer to the image below ), so that users will not get optin message when they send the message for the first time. Glific provides an easier way to get optin preferences from a flow. Refer [Configure Optin & Optout preferences in Glific](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Flows/Others/Configure%20Optin%20&%20Optout%20preferences%20in%20Glific/) for more details.
